This is a JavaFX Version of the Valids-Ticket application which
was written in C++ and Qt.

There are several reasons why I decided to create a new version
of the Valids application.

1. The Valids (C++) application would not build under OSX. I don't know
the reason why. The errors are pretty subtle and a Google search
says that the errors are related to the version of C++ being used.

However, when the suggested changes are applied, the errors do not
disappear. Since I do not have an iMac in which I can test the
build, the possibility that I would be able to solve the build
problem is not good.

2. Writing a new version of Valids under JavaFX would allow me practice
in some key JavaFX technologies: Pagelayouting, String manipulation, 
file opening and closing, use of the print and file dialogs, etc.

The educational side effect of writing the software again in JavaFX
seems to be significant and would be very useful in my objectives.
